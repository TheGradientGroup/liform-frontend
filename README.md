# Liform

Liform is a tool for looking up and comparing the price of medical procedures at different hospitals. It helps patients make informed decisions about their healthcare.
- Users can **share** the price they paid for a certain diagnosis related group.
- Users can **look up** an estimate of how much they might pay at nearby hospitals.
- Users can see how much **other patients** have paid for similar diagnosis related groups.
